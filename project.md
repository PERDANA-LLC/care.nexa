Here is an explanation of the job post, written for a fifth grader:

### **The Main Idea: Building a Super-App for Helpers**

Imagine a nurse named the "Client." She wants to hire a computer programmer to build a brand-new website called **CareNexa**.

Think of CareNexa like a **digital command center** for people who take care of others. It’s not just for doctors in hospitals; it’s for people who visit sick people at home, drivers who take patients to appointments, and even therapists.

The nurse needs someone who can build the whole thing from scratch—the part you see on the screen and the invisible brain behind it that makes it work.

***

### **What Does the App Need to Do?**
The programmer has **4 months** to build the first version of the app. It needs to do these seven main things:

1.  **The Keys:** Let different people log in (like the boss, the nurses, and the drivers). Everyone sees a different screen depending on their job.
2.  **The List:** Keep a list of all the workers and all the patients.
3.  **The Calendar:** A schedule so everyone knows where to go and when (like a school timetable).
4.  **The Diary:** A place to type notes about how the patient is feeling. (Different patients need different kinds of notes).
5.  **The Calculator:** A way to track the work so the company can send a bill and get paid.
6.  **The Scoreboard:** A main screen that shows quick stats (like how many appointments are happening today).
7.  **The Walkie-Talkie:** A chat room so the workers can talk to each other.

### **Who is the Boss?**
The person hiring is a nurse who is working on this project all by herself.
*   She knows exactly what she wants.
*   She wants to see what you built **every single week** (like showing your homework to a teacher).
*   She has all the forms and rules ready; she just needs someone to type the code.

***

### **The Reward and The Rules**
*   **The Pay:** She will pay between **$15,000 and $25,000** for the whole project.
*   **The Deadline:** You have exactly **16 weeks** (4 months) to finish.
*   **How to Apply:** To get the job, you have to show her apps you’ve built before and prove you can finish on time.
